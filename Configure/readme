Overview
--------
The compiler options are system-specific and are stored in the files under 'arch'.

The preprocessor flags are configuration-specfic and are set in the files under 'config'.

The ./setup script selects an arch and config file (see below), and also rewrites make.inc by pasting the pieces together and setting TOPDIR.

The Makefile ensures that make.inc is rewritten before calling make as requested.

Compiling FVCOM
---------------

1) Select an architecture (-a) and configuration (-c) with './setup'. Example:

  ./setup -a GPSC-IFORT-2013 -c VancouverHarbourV2

  To see available arch/configs use: ./setup -l
  To generate the ./setup commands, use: ./setup -g

2) Use "make libs" to compile the external libraries under FVCOM_source/libs

3) Use "make gotm" to fetch/compile GOTM under GOTM_source (optional).

4) Use "make fvcom" to build FVCOM.

These steps may be combined into one line: make libs gotm fvcom
